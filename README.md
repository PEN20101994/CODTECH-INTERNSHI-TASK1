OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

A simple LED blinking project involves programming a microcontroller (like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to turn an LED on and off at regular intervals. The main components include:

1. LED (Light Emitting Diode): The visual indicator that will blink.


2. Microcontroller: The brain of the system, often using platforms like Arduino.


3. Power Supply: Powers the microcontroller and LED.


4. Resistor: Used to limit the current going to the LED to avoid damage.



Working:

The microcontroller is programmed to send high (on) and low (off) signals to the LED at a set interval, creating the blink effect. This basic project helps in learning how to work with microcontrollers, programming logic, and electronic circuits
